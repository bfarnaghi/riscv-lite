# RISC-V Lite Processor

This repository contains an implementation of a 5-stage RISC-V RV32I processor in VHDL. The design is lightweight and educational, which is ideal for learning about the RISC-V architecture and pipeline processor design.

## Features

- **RISC-V RV32I**: Implements the base integer instruction set of the RISC-V architecture.
- **5-Stage Pipeline**: The processor is designed with a 5-stage pipeline consisting of Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, and Write-back stages.
- **VHDL Implementation**: The entire processor is written in VHDL, making it suitable for FPGA implementation and simulation.
